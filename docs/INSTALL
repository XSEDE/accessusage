** accessusage-%VER%-%REL% Install Instructions
**********************************************

Instructions for installing accessusage from RPM (recommended) or from TAR.


**********************
** RPM Installation **
**********************

R1) Configure trust in the XSEDE-Production repository

   a) Browse the following directory and copy the link to the package that matches your operating system:
      https://software.xsede.org/production/repo/repos/

   b) Install the package at the link you copied above:
      rpm -i https://software.xsede.org/production/repo/repos/XSEDE-Production-config.<OPERATING SYSTEM>.noarch.rpm

   You may see a warning like this:
      warning: XSEDE-Production-config.centos-5-1.noarch.rpm: Header V3 DSA signature: NOKEY, key ID 20423dbb

   This is a signature trust bootstrapping issue because until you complete this entire procedure, RPM doesn't trust the signer of this RPM.

   c) Lastly, configure RPM to trust XSEDE's signature (PGP key) installed in the previous step:
      rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-XSEDE-Production

   SECURITY NOTE:
   If you need greater security assurance modify the above procedure as follows:
   a') Browse the package directory using https and review the server's HTTPS/TLS host certificate
   b') Download the package over https using your favorite secure download tool
   c') Verify the RPM before you install it using "rpm -Kv <package>"

   DEVELOPMENT REPO NOTE: If you are installing XSEDE-Development repository packages, follow this procedure:
      https://software.xsede.org/development/repo/repoconfig.txt

R2) Install accessusage

   NOTE: This package automatically creates an "accessusage" account that owns the files and will
         execute accessusage via sudo.

   Install via rpm/yum these pre-requisites:
   - sudo

   To install to the default location “/usr/local/accessusage-%VER%-%REL%” use these commands:
   # yum install accessusage

   To install to a different location, say “/soft/accessusage-%VER%-%REL%”, use these commands:
   # yum install yum-downloadonly
   # yum update accessusage -y --downloadonly --downloaddir=./
   # rpm -i --prefix=<INSTALL_DIR> ./accessusage-%VER%%REL%-1.noarch.rpm


R3) Edit /etc/sudoers to grant permission for everyone to run accessusage as the non_root user "accessusage" (created when the rpm was installed).
    This can be done by adding these lines:

      Defaults!<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/accessusage env_keep="USER"
      Defaults!<INSTALL_DIR>/bin/accessusage runas_default=accessusage
      ALL ALL=(accessusage) NOPASSWD: <INSTALL_DIR>/bin/accessusage

R4) Create the accessusage_v1.conf (legacy XDCDB database) and accessusage_v2.conf (new ACDB database) files.   

    MIGRATING FROM XDUSAGE: If you have an existing xdusage.conf file, you can copy it over to /etc/accessusage_v1.conf.  
    The /etc/accessusage_v2.conf can then be created by 
        a) copying the <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/accessusage_v2.conf.example to /etc/accessusage_v2.conf
        b) Submit a ticket to explictly request your XDCDB key over to ACDB.  I.e.,

           Subject: ACDB API-KEY copy request
   
           Please copy the following HASH for agent xdusage on resource <RESOURCE NAME>
   
           <key hash>
   
           on server https://allocations-api.access-ci.org/acdb/
        c) Copy your api_id, api_key, and resource values from /etc/accessusage_v1.conf to /etc/accessusage_v2.conf
 
    
    OTHERWISE: The following steps will need to be generate the /etc/accessusage_v2.conf file 
 
        a) Run the accessusage script as root and it will create an initial configuration file for you at 
           /etc/accessusage_v2.conf.  The script will set the ownership to root:accessusage and the file permissions to 640.

           You can also create the configuration file youself instead.
           Examine the example file <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/accessusage_v2.conf.example for further guidance.
           This example file may be used with minor editing. 
   
           The accessusage script looks for the configuration file in the following ordered locations:
               /etc/accessusage_v2.conf,
               /var/secrets/accessusage_v2.conf,
               <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/accessusage_v2.conf
           This file will contain secrets, so should NOT have world-readable permissions.
           Set its mode to 0640 with owned:group set to root:accessusage.

        b) An API key needs to be generated and configured in the accessusage_v2.conf files. A hash of that 
           API key also needs to be configured into the API that accessusage will call. Instructions for generating the API key 
           and hash and for getting the hash configured in the API are at https://allocations-api.access-ci.org/acdb.

           A resource_name and api_id also needs to be configured in the accessusage_v2.conf file. The resource_name is used by 
           accessusage to map usernames to people in the ACDB. The api_id (along with the api_key) are used to authenticate 
           accessusage to the API. Both of these values should be the same and must match the XDCDB Resource Name as listed at:
            
           https://info.xsede.org/wh1/warehouse-views/v1/resources-xdcdb-active/?format=html;sort=ResourceID
    
           An example accessusage_v2.conf file with the information needed by the API:
             resource_name     = ranger.tacc.teragrid
             rest_url_base     = https://allocations-api.access-ci.org/acdb
             api_id            = ranger.tacc.teragrid
             api_key           = abcdgzCvPliUd2Hxa2k6Z3KCQzbgs8uSzjQpn2O4+62mEO9aEDTYJqcRhktODxyz
             admin_name        = mshapiro

R5) Install an accessusage modules file to make it easier for users to access it. Copy the sample file in
    <INSTALL_DIR>/etc/accessusage.modules.example to /usr/local/Modules/modulefiles/accessusage/%VER%-%REL%
    (or a Module directory of your choosing) and mark the default by specifying %VER%-%REL% in the
    associated /usr/local/Modules/modulefiles/accessusage/.version file.

R6) Look at the docs/INSTALL_Testing document for a sanity-check command line to run.


**********************
** TAR Installation **
**********************

Prerequisites: sudo and Python3

Installation steps:

T1) Download the latest accessusage package and signature from:
    https://software.xsede.org/production/accessusage/latest/
    Verify the downloaded package against the signature

T2) Untar the package:
    tar -xzvf accessusage-%VER%-%REL%.tgz

T3) Copy accessusage-%VER%-%REL%/bin/accessusage to a directory of your choosing, <INSTALL_DIR>.
    The accessusage file should have permissions 0555, owned by root:root, so that it is not
    inadvertently changed.  DO NOT make this file owned by the accessusage user described below.

T4) Create a non-root user and dedicated group that does not map to an actual person.
    We'll refer to this user as 'accessusage' and group 'accessusage', though you can use any name you
    choose.  Generally, you'll want to set this user with: 
      shell=/dev/null 
      password disabled ('*' in the shadow file) 
      home=/

T5) Follow steps R3) thru R6) above
