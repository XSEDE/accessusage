.SH PROJECTS
Projects, specified by
.BR -p ,
are of the form XXXXXXXXX (e.g., IRI160007)
If
.B -p
is not specified, only those projects with non-expired allocations are reported.
If
.B -p
is specified, then the latest allocation for those projects are reported (unless
.B -pa
is specified, and then the allocation just prior to the latest is reported). 

Mutiple projects can be specified by separating them with spaces:

.IP
accessusage -p XXXXXXX YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZZ

.PP
NOTE: only projects that you have an account on will be reported. 
If you specify a project you are not on, accessusage will not show it.

.SH ALLOCATIONS
Projects have allocations on one or more resources.
There may be more than one allocation for a given project on a given resource.
accessusage will show the latest allocation for each resource on a project, unless the
.B -pa
option is specfied, then the allocation previous to the latest will be show. 
.PP
If you wish to only see allocations on specific resources, use the 
.B -r
option:
.IP
accessusage -r forge.ncsa.teragrid
.PP
The resource name may be abbreviated
.IP
accessusage -r forge
.PP
Allocations may be inactive, either because they have expired or are out of funds.
If the
.B -p
option is not specified, then only allocations which are not expired will be shown (even if they are inactive)
If
.B -p
is used, then the latest allocations will be shown (even if they are expired or inactive)
.PP
If you wish to only see active allocations, use the
.B -ip
option.

.SH USERS
By default, accessusage will only show your account usage.
If you want to see usage for all users on the projects, specify the
.B -a
option. If you want to only see usage for a specific user, specify the
.B -u
or
.B -up
options. 
The
.B -u
option requires either the username on the system you are running accessusage from, or the user's last name
(capitalized first letter). 
Alternatively, if you know the portal username for a user, you can use the
.B -up
option.
Mutiple users can be specified by separating the names with spaces:

.IP
accessusage -u squinn Shapiro -u Jones -up cpond

.PP
A percent sign (%) can be used as a wildcard:

.IP
accessusage -u S%
